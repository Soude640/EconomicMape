Economic Adaption in MAPE
MAPE framework has 4 components of Monitoring, Analysis, Planning and Execution and it is used to monitor and enhance software systems periodically. each of the four components can be implemented differently depending on the purpose of the system but usually in monitoring phase we get some measurements and insights from the system, in the analysis phase we use that data to give the owner some warnings or change some aspects of the system in order for it to work correctly. in the planning phase we make some decisions based on the pervious data for the system and in the final phase we apply those decisions to the system. and this phases run periodically (for example every hour) to keep up with the environment.
